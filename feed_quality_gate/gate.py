"""Evaluate a feed against a rule set and partition it.

Two entry points:

``evaluate`` answers "is this feed trustworthy?" and returns a report.
``gate`` additionally answers "which rows are safe?" and splits the frame.

Both are pure: they never write to a database and never touch the network, so
the same call works from a CLI, an Airflow task, or a test.
