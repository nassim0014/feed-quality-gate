"""Declarative rule configuration.

Rules are data, not code. A new feed is onboarded by writing a YAML file, not
by editing this package — that is what makes the gate reusable across the
scraped-price feed, an accounting extract, or anything else tabular.

No feed schema is hardcoded anywhere in this repo. Column names always come
from the rules file.
